# Site exliceos
This is a website I created for people who graduated from my previous school, Liceo de Monterrey, which I finished on March 2022. It contains general information of interest to all former students, but has a main focus on the "Torneo" (tournament) section. This is where all the statistics and data about the soccer tournament is stored and can be visualized by everyone. It is being used at the moment by 100+ users which all are participants of the soccer tournament.

For this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, as well as storing information on MySQL.
Even though I structured the site with HTML, I implemented the Bootstrap 5 framework a lot to style the page and be consistent.
The pages concerning the tournament contain dynamic information which is updated once a week when the tournament games take place. For this I developed an administrator environment which contains forms where data of the tournament can be updated, with no need to modify the code. 

I used InfinityFree's free plan as the hosting service and namecheap to buy the domain.
It is currently on https://www.exliceos.com/
